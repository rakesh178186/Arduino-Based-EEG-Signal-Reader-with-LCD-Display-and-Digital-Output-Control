This project demonstrates the use of an Arduino to read and process EEG (electroencephalogram) signals, displaying the data on an LCD screen and controlling digital outputs based on signal values. The system continuously monitors EEG signals from analog inputs, processes the values to filter noise, and displays the real-time data on a 16x2 LCD. Additionally, it uses specific signal thresholds to activate or deactivate digital outputs, enabling interaction with external devices. This project can be used as a foundation for developing brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), neuroscience research tools, or interactive systems that respond to EEG signals.
